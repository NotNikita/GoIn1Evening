Now, open the `01-start/01-hello/main.go` file from your training directory in your favorite text editor.

Don't worry if you don't understand all of it yet. We'll discuss the details soon.

For now, look for the line with a double-quoted `"Hello"`:

```go
fmt.Println("Hello")
```

This line prints the text `Hello` on the screen (in the terminal). The program then exits.

## Exercise

File: `01-start/01-hello/main.go`

Change the text to say `Hello, World!`. Remember to keep it within the double quotes.
